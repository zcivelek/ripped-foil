```{r global_options, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, include=TRUE)

#This sets general options for the code chunks in the R Markdown file. The echo, warning, and message = FALSE hide the code chunks, warning messages, and other messages, where the ‘include=true’ will make all figures appear in the text. You can set some of these variables to TRUE, and hit Knit to see what they change. Sometimes you might want to share the HTML file with all code visible, for example when sharing with collaborators.

#Introduction

Here, we analyze a simple dataset of a Stroop experiment. Students in an introduction to psychology course completed an online Stroop task (http://faculty.washington.edu/chudler/java/ready.html) and named the colors in congruent trials (e.g., the word 'red' written in a red font) and in incongruent trials (e.g., the word 'red' written in a green font). The time they took to name all words was self-reported in seconds (e.g., 21.3 seconds) for both the congruent and incongruent blocks. In this analysis, we are interested in examining whether there is a Stroop effect. 

```{r}
# #run only once to download the data
# stroop_data <- read.table("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Lakens/Stroop/master/stroop.txt", sep = "\t", header = TRUE)
# 
# write.table(stroop_data, file = "stroop.csv", quote=F, row.names=F)

stroop_data <- read.csv("stroop.csv", sep = " ", header = TRUE)

```

#Plotting the data

When we plot the rection times, we can visually see that there are no extreme outliers. It is also clear that response times are generally faster for the congruent trials, compared to the incongruent trials. 

```{r, fig.width=4, fig.heigth=4, dpi=150}
#Draw scatterplot

if(!require(ggplot2)){install.packages('ggplot2')}
library(ggplot2)

# Main scatterplot
ggplot(stroop_data, aes(x=Congruent, y=Incongruent)) + 
  geom_point(alpha = 0.35) +
  theme_bw(base_size=14) +
  geom_smooth(method='lm',formula=y~x, color='black') + 
  coord_fixed() + 
  ylab("Incongruent")  + xlab("Congruent") +
  theme(plot.margin= unit(c(0, 0, 0.5, 0.5), "lines"))
  

```
